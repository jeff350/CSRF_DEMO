# CSRF_DEMO #
## Summary##
This is a Flask web application That I have developed for educational purposese to demonstrate CSRF Vulnerabilities. This code is not designed to be secure and shoul not be reused.

## Description ##
This is a simple application that simulates a Bank. users are able to signup for an account where they instantly have $500. There is functionallity that allows a suer to send money to another user. The transaction page will accept values in a GET request which is one way an attacker could trick a user into sending money to their own account.
